# TSX View/Edit

![TSX View/Edit Screenshot](https://github.com/01esyaLebedeva/tsx_viewer/blob/7eb05d71a16647c4a9a5a6cd98b48c17cbf7274c/docs/images/screen_03_TSX_edit.png?raw=true)

**TSX View/Edit** is a minimalist, cross-platform desktop application for viewing and interactively previewing `.tsx` files. It positions the TSX file as a new, self-contained format for interactive content, similar to what Flash animations once were.

With the rise of AI services like Anthropic's Claude, which can generate UI components as downloadable TSX "artifacts," this tool empowers not just developers, but also regular users to open, view, and interact with these new forms of content without needing a full development environment.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Live Preview:** Instantly see the rendered output of your TSX code.
*   **Code Editor:** Make changes to the code and see the results immediately.
*   **Dependency Support:** The application uses a CodeSandbox environment to automatically handle npm dependencies specified in your code.
*   **Resizable Panels:** Adjust the size of the editor and preview panels for a comfortable workflow.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux and Windows.
*   **Internationalization:** Supports English and Russian languages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Runtime:** Electron
*   **UI Framework:** React
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Bundler:** Vite
*   **Sandbox:** `@codesandbox/sandpack-react`

## üì¶ Installation and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/01esyaLebedeva/tsx_viewer.git
    cd tsx_viewer
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run in development mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The bundled files will appear in the `dist-electron` directory.

## üí° Speeding Up the Build (for Windows)

If you are working on Windows and do not intend to create packages for Linux (`snap`, `AppImage`, etc.), you can temporarily disable the Linux build to speed up the `npm run build` process.

To do this, find the `build` section in the `package.json` file and rename the `linux` key to `_linux`:

```json
"build": {
  ...
  "_linux": { // <-- Key renamed
    "desktop": "src/tsx_viewer.desktop",
    "category": "Utility;Development;Viewer;",
    "icon": "src/icons/tsx_viewer.png",
    "target": [
      "snap",
      "AppImage",
      "deb",
      "pacman"
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

To re-enable the Linux build, simply rename the key back to `linux`.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Integration

This project is configured for effective collaboration with AI assistants like Gemini. To facilitate a deep understanding of the project's structure, it uses a `project_graph.jsonnet` file.

**What is it?**
`project_graph.jsonnet` is a structured description of the project, including:
*   Key files and components.
*   Their purpose and dependencies.
*   Interaction channels (e.g., IPC messages in Electron).

**Why is it needed?**
This file allows the AI assistant to quickly build a "mental map" of the project, leading to more accurate and context-aware coding, refactoring, and analysis.

**How to work with it?**
1.  **Keep it updated:** When adding new key components or changing interaction logic, please update `project_graph.jsonnet`.
2.  **Use Jsonnet:** You may need [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) to work with the file.
3.  **Audit the Graph:** To ensure the graph is in sync with the actual project files, run the audit script:
    ```bash
    npm run graph:audit
    ```
4.  **Let the AI Commit:** To create clean, atomic commits based on the graph's rules, ask your AI assistant to run the committer script. It will automatically group and commit your changes.
