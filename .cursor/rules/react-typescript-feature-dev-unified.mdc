# Unified Feature Development Rules (React 19 + TypeScript)

---

## 1. Base Practices
- Follow existing folder/component naming patterns.
- Check for reusable functions before creating new ones.
- All new components must have explicit props & state types.
- Add JSDoc for public component props.
- Integrate into the existing state management pattern.
- Place all feature files in designated folders with `index.ts` exports.
- Include unit tests for all new logic.

---

## 2. WFGY Semantic Layer
- **BBMC**: New props/state must trace from data source to UI without logic gaps.
- **BBPF**: Add explicit guards for conditionals and branching logic.
- **BBCR**: Async flows must confirm intended result from the cause chain.
- **BBAM**: New logic must align with existing architecture & abstractions.

---

## 3. Quality Checks
- Linting must pass.
- Test coverage must not decrease.
- API calls must handle all result states (success/failure/timeout).
