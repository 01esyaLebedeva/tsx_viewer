## Branching rules

- Main branches `main` and `develop` is prohibited - changes to them are made only through pull requests.
- Temporary branches are used for developing new features and fixes:
`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `doc/*` and similar.
- The Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification (<https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>) is used to name temporary branches and format commit messages.
- This rule ensures uniformity and automation of release and integration processes.
