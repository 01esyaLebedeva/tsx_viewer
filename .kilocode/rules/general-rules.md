# Recommendations

- Use context7 tool when you use a new library, create a new integration.
- Use Sequential thinking for complex reflections.
- Use context7 to access documentation of all libraries.
- To implement any features using integrations with external api/libraries, study the documentation using context7 tools.
- At the beginning of each session, read and parse `project_graph.jsonnet` to build a mental model of the project's architecture and dependencies.
